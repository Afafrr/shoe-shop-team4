## Technologies used

We have used a modern technology stack to develop this robust, scalable, and high-performance web application. Our choice of tools focused on enhancing user experience, optimizing performance, and simplifying data management and API requests. Each technology was selected to serve a specific role, from building interactive user interfaces to efficiently managing data and ensuring secure authentication. We present the key technologies used and their role in the project’s success:

#### Next.js and Typescript
Ability to create dynamic and scalable web applications with more secure and maintainable code.

#### Material UI
Makes it easy to create modern and stylish user interfaces.

#### React Hook Form / Zod
Efficient form management with robust schema validation using Zod.

#### React Query 
Used to handle state and synchronization of remote data, simplifying API requests and cache management.

#### NextAuth
Authentication and session management with multi-vendor support.
